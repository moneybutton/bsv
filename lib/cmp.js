/**
 * Constant-Time Buffer Compare
 * ============================
 *
 * A constant-time comparison function. This should be used in any security
 * sensitive code where leaking timing information may lead to lessened
 * security. Note that if the buffers are not equal in length, this function
 * loops for the longest buffer, which may not be necessary. Usually this
 * function should be used for buffers that would otherwise be equal length,
 * such as a hash, particularly Hmacs.
 *
 * The algorithm here, which is XORs each byte (or, if undefined, 0) with the
 * corresponding other byte, and then ORs that with a running total (d), is
 * adapted from here:
